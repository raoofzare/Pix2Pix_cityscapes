# Pix2Pix_cityscapes
This repository contains an implementation of the Pix2Pix framework, a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) designed for image-to-image translation tasks. Pix2Pix demonstrates impressive results on tasks such as semantic label-to-photo synthesis, style transfer, and more. Here, the focus is on applying Pix2Pix to the Cityscapes dataset, a widely used dataset for urban scene understanding.

Features:
Uses the U-Net generator and PatchGAN discriminator for efficient training and translation.
Implements semantic label-to-image translation for Cityscapes dataset.
